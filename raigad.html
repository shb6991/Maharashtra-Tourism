                <p>Raigad Fort (Raigad)</p><br><br><br>
                
                <li>Raigad is situated in the taluka of Mahad and the fort rises 820 meters above sea level. As historical records show, the fort was known by different names at different times, including Tanas, Rasivata, Nandadeep and Rayari. It was initially under the control of Chandrarao More of Jawali and captured by Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj's when he defeated More in a fierce battle in 1656 CE.</li><br>
                <li>following which he re-named it Raigad. It was around this time that the boundaries of the Maratha Empire i.e. Swarajya were expanding and Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj's felt the need to shift the capital from Rajgad.</li><br> 
                <li>He therefore set his sights on Raigad, a fort he liked because of its steepness and a rather peculiar structure which would dissuade his enemies or make it too difficult for them to attack it.</li><br>
                <li> Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj's then deployed Hiroji Indulkar, an architect and engineer, to carry out the necessary modifications as well as add new structures to accommodate his army.</li><br>
                    <li>This inscription is in Sanskrit and Devnagari script. But while these were all man-made structures, Raigad also offered one of the most natural protections through its Bhavani Tok and Takmak Tok with vertigo-inducing drops of 400 meters on both sides. A famous structure on the fort is locally called as the Hirkani Buruj. A very popular legend is associated with it.</li>
